                <h1>I. INTRODUCTION</h1>

                <p>Awesome Innovation Apps (“we,” “us” or “our”) takes your privacy seriously. This Privacy policy (“Privacy policy”) explains our data protection policy and describes the types of information we may process when you install and/or use <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1619382448">“Forms APP”</a> software application for mobile devices (the “App”, “our App”) and explains how we and some of the companies we cooperate while processing that information.<br></p>

                <p>When we refer to personal data (or personal information) we mean any information of any kind relating to a natural person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to such data.</p>
                <p>It is a natural person who can be identified directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his or her physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social status.</p>
                <p>Our Privacy policy applies to all users, and others who access the App (“Users”).</p>
                <p>For the purposes of the GDPR, we are the data controller, unless otherwise stated.</p>
                <p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PRIVACY POLICY, FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE WAYS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED, CAREFULLY. WHEN YOU USE THE APP YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.</p>

                <h1>II. INFORMATION WE PROCESS</h1>
                <p>There are two general categories of information we can process.</p>

                <h2>II.1 Information that you submit </h2>
                <p>We process the following personal information about you when you use the App. This information is necessary for the adequate <strong>performance of the contract</strong> between you and us. Without such information it is impossible to provide complete functionality of the App and perform the requested services.</p>
                <ul>
<!--                    <li><strong>Authorization and/or Account Information.</strong> When you sign up for an account, we require your email.</li>-->
<!--                    <li><strong>Other Information</strong> directly related to your use of the App, such as photos and documents you upload to the App. Upon your consent we also may have access to your camera roll.</li>-->
                    <li><strong>Usage of Google Forms data on your Google Drive</strong></li>
                            1. This application only uses data related to user's Google forms on their Google drive.
                        <br>2. No Google forms data is collected and/or shared with any 3rd party application.
                        <br>3. App's use of information received from Google Drive APIs will adhere to <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes"> Google's Limited Use Requirements</a>.
                    <li><strong>Log Data</strong></li>
                        In case of an error while using our app, we collect data and information (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.
                </ul>

                <h2>II.2 Information That Is Processed Automatically</h2>
                <p>When you use the App, some information about your device and your user behaviour may be processed automatically. This information is generally non-personal, i.e. it does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual, and we may access it only in aggregated form. We process this information on the ground of our <strong>legitimate interest</strong> in improving our App and giving our users the best experience. If we do not access such data we may not be able to provide you with all the requested services and features of the App.</p>
                <p>We use third-party automatic data processing technologies to analyze certain information sent by your device or our App. Automatic data processing technologies (advertising or analytics tools) provide us with the data described below. We do not control, supervise or respond for how the third parties process your personal data, that might be collected by their own means (not through our App). Due to the fact that some of our third parties (such as <a href="https://www.mopub.com/legal/privacy/?devname=iPhone7,1&amp;iosver=12.4.7&amp;appver=3.30.9">MoPub</a>) declare themselves controllers for the purposes of the GDPR, any information request regarding your personal data should be directed to such third parties.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Information related to your device.</strong> When you use a mobile device (tablet / phone / smartwatch) to access our App, we may monitor one or more “device identifiers”. Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. Device identifier enables generalized reporting or personalized content and ads by the third parties.<p></p>
                    <p>What data can be processed:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>type of your mobile device and operational system version which is installed on your mobile device;</li>
                        <li>region information of your mobile device;</li>
                        <li>region associated with your SIM card; </li>
                        <li>Internet Protocol (“IP”) address;</li>
                        <li>Identity For Advertisers / Advertising ID which is a string of numbers and letters that identifies your individual smartphone or tablet.</li>
                    </ol>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Log file information.</strong> Log file information is automatically reported each time you make a request to access the App. It can also be provided when the App is installed on your device. When you use our App, analytics tools automatically record certain log file information, including time and date when you start and stop using the App, and how you interact with the App.
                        <p>The App may use automated processing of your personal data, including profiling, which means any form of automated processing of personal data used to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to you, in particular to analyze or predict aspects concerning your personal preferences, interests, behavior, location or movements. Processing information through automatic data processing technologies starts automatically when you start using the App.</p></li>

                    <li><strong>Cookies and similar technologies.</strong> When you use the App, we may use cookies and similar technologies like pixels, web beacons, scripts to process information about how you use our App and provide features to you. A cookie is a text file containing small amounts of information which is downloaded to your device when you access the App. The text file is then sent back to our server each time you use the App. This enables us to operate the App more effectively. For example, we will know how many users access a specific areas or features within our App and which links or ads they clicked on. We use this aggregated information to understand and optimize how our App is used, improve our marketing efforts, and provide content and features that are of interest to you. We may ask advertisers or other partners to serve ads or services to the App, which may use cookies or similar technologies. </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>III. THE PURPOSES OF PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>

                <p>Our mission is to constantly improve our App and provide you with new experiences. As part of this mission, we use your information for the following purposes:</p>

                <p>(c)  <strong>To provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content.</strong> We may use information that is processed automatically for marketing purposes (to show ads that may be of interest to you based on your preferences). We provide personalized content and information to you, which can include online ads or other forms of marketing.</p>
                <p>(d)  <strong>To communicate with you.</strong> We use the information we have to communicate with you through newsletters, i.e. to send you marketing notifications, receive your feedback about our App experience, and let you know about our policies and terms.

                <p>(e)  <strong>To prevent fraud and spam, to enforce the law.</strong> We really want our App to be free of spam and fraudulent content so that you feel safe and free. We may use your information to prevent, detect, and investigate fraud, security breaches, potentially prohibited or illegal activities, protect our trademarks and enforce our Terms of Use. </p>
                <p>If any new purposes for processing your personal data arise we will let you know we start to process information on that other purpose by introducing the corresponding changes to this Privacy policy.</p>

                <h2 id="fourth-sharing">IV. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
                <p>We will share your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy policy. We adhere to the U.S. Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for the Mobile Environment.</p>
                <p>We will not rent or sell your personal data to any third parties, but we may share your information from tools like cookies, log files, and device identifiers and location data, with third-party organizations that provide automatic data processing technologies for the App. We do not control or influence these third parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used.</p>
                <p>We may also share certain information such as cookie data with third-party advertising partners. This information allows third-party ad networks, inter alia, to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.</p>

                <p>We may engage the following third parties in order to provide us with necessary infrastructure for delivery and improvement of our services:</p>
